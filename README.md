# Computer-Networks-Simulation-Project-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
This project simulates a comprehensive small-scale enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network topology integrates 19 routers, 7 switches, multiple end-user devices, and 3 core servers (DHCP, Email, Web). Routing protocols including RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP are configured to support both legacy and dynamic route management across segmented LANs.
